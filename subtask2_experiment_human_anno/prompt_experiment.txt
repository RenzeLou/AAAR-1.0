You are partially given an NLP paper (in latex), including some useful sections (e.g., 'abstract' and 'introduction') having some basic introductions to the research of this paper, where all the 'experiment' related sections are deleted.

Please first help me carefully read these sections and try to understand the motivations of this research, such as 'what the authors are trying to propose/demonstrate?' and 'what are the main contributions/differences of this paper from others?'

Then, based on your in-depth understanding of this paper, imagine that you are the authors of this paper; what experiments do you have to conduct to prove your research? Namely, you have to **recover the deleted experiments** by providing me with **a list of experiment ideas**, where the list briefly summarizes the experiments the authors should conduct.

Here is an example:
```
1. Cross-label generalisation comparison with the previous works. Since this work proposes a new method for open-domain relation type discovery, the authors should test this idea on some widely used benchmarks, such as FewRel.
2. Semantic representation visualisation on the test set. The authors should conduct further visualisation by using some dimension-reduce methods (e.g., t-SNE) on the widely adopted cross-label test set (e.g., FewRel).
3. and so on ...
```

Here is the target NLP paper (partial content):

Now, based on this paper, give me a list of experiments the author has to do. Please only give me the list, without any other words.
